# Softmax Regression for MNIST Dataset

## Overview

This repository provides an implementation of Softmax Regression for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Softmax Regression is a machine learning model used for multiclass classification problems. In this implementation, NumPy is used for computations, and no deep learning libraries are employed.

## Introduction

Softmax Regression, also known as Multinomial Logistic Regression, is an extension of logistic regression for multi-class classification problems. It models the probability distribution over multiple classes and uses the Softmax function to predict class probabilities.

In this project, we apply Softmax Regression to the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the task is to classify each image into one of 10 possible digits.

## Setup

To run the code, you need to have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
